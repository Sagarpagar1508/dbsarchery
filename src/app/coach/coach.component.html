        <h1>ABOUT COACH</h1>
        <p class="px-2 fs-5">
            <span class="">Mr. Sameer Prabhakar Mhaske</span> is The Head coach of D.B.S. He is a National player of 2007 (Archery). He achieved this position by his own efforts. He worked hard for the same and reached this level. As his dream was to play for our country on the international level but because of financial conditions at home and lack of guidance, he could not continue. As he realized, he decided to give coaching to students who wanted to learn Archery. He started coaching Archery from 2009 on the nearby ground for free of cost and the result of it was amazing. So many students participated in Archery competitions at district level, National level, and International level. Initially, he started managing the expenditure on Archery training for the local students from his own pocket, which was quite difficult for him, but as the achievements started, people began supporting him because of his dedication and hard work. He got a chance to be a National Archery Coach for 2020. Tokyo Olympic National camp held in Pune, and the most appreciable part was his student Shukmani Babrekar was selected for the Tokyo Olympic National camp, and <b>Mr. Sameer Prabhakar Mhaske, who was the Archery trainer for the National Camp Tokyo 2020 Olympic (Pune)</b> were both from Paratwada, district Amravati. We salute him and wish him great success for the social work he is doing.
